# Hello, folks! üëã

I am <s>Victor Matheus</s> _Geraldo Castro_ (he/him). I'm a passionate **software developer** living in Florianop√≥lis, Brazil, working for Thoughtworks as Technical Leader. I mainly code in Python, in 2021 I fell in love with Go. I love being part of development of web technologies. I like to organize conferences and give talks, I'm always learning and sharing. Currently I'm trying to work on a couple of open-source projects, including my own [`noseiquela-orm`](https://github.com/exageraldo/noseiquela-orm/), which is a small and expressive ORM to interact with Google Datastore inspired by Django, Mongo-Engine and Peewee. I also am contributing to projects as [`go-github`](https://github.com/google/go-github/) and some initiatives as [`Grupy-RN`](https://github.com/grupyrn/) and [`Dados Abertos de Feira`](https://github.com/DadosAbertosDeFeira/).

When I'm not developing and coding or organizing community events, you can find me watching cartoons, listening to music, or rollerblading.
